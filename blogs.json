      "content": "<p>Imagine stopping by your favorite grocery store only to find barren shelves and shockingly high prices. This scenario is not as unlikely as you might think. Global supply chains, largely unseen by ordinary consumers, work 24/7 across the globe to ensure that products are available at reasonable prices.</p><p>These supply chains are more fragile than they might appear. Recent events have shown just how vulnerable international trade is to disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted maritime operations, causing delays and congestion that rippled through global supply chains. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly impacted the global food supply, driving up food prices, reducing grain exports, and exacerbating food insecurity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where transport costs can account for up to 50% of food prices. More recently, attacks on shipping in the Gulf of Aden have disrupted critical maritime trade routes, resulting in increased shipping costs and delays.</p><p>The potential impact goes far beyond your kitchen pantry. Supply chain disruptions can affect anything—electronics, automobiles, medical supplies, factory equipment, consumer goods, and more—and without warning. The resulting inventory shortages, operational inefficiencies, production delays, and increased costs can wreak havoc on economies, especially in developing countries.</p><h2>Container ports to the rescue</h2><p>Nobody knows what threats will appear in the future. But we do know that container ports—the indispensable hubs of global commerce—can play a role in protecting global trade from unforeseen disruptions. Container ports are the lifelines of global trade, particularly for developing countries. Over 80% of international trade is transported via sea routes, with a substantial portion carried in containers. Efficient container ports reduce the cost and time associated with importing and exporting goods, making exports more competitive and lowering import prices. High-performing ports attract foreign investment, support local industries, create jobs, and boost income levels, fostering sustainable economic development.</p><p>How can container ports protect global trade from unforeseen disruptions? Consider the following:</p><ul><li><span>Investing in port facilities </span>can expand their capacity to handle increased shipping volumes and support smoother, faster operations.</li><li><span>Adopting advanced digital technologies </span>can streamline operations, reduce paperwork, and improve data exchange, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing the impact of disruptions.</li><li><span>Building connections</span>with inland transportation networks like railways, roads, and waterways ensures seamless movement of goods from ports to their final destinations.</li><li><span>Collaborating with stakeholders</span>such as shipping lines, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders to better manage disruptions and maintain continuity in port operations.</li></ul><p>Building the resilience of ports requires reliable and consistent data. Accurate performance metrics can help governments and other stakeholders identify inefficiencies and target specific areas for improvement. Good data allows for informed decision-making, enabling ports to implement strategic interventions that boost resilience and efficiency. This approach ensures that investments in infrastructure, technology, and processes are directed where they are needed most, which helps protect global trade against unforeseen disruptions.</p><h2>The Container Port Performance Index</h2><p>Since 2020, the World Bank and S&P Global Market Intelligence have published the Container Port Performance Index (CPPI) to provide insights into the efficiency of container ports worldwide. By measuring and ranking the performance of over 400 global ports, the CPPI helps stakeholders identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement. The CPPI uses indicators such as operational efficiency, measured by vessel turnaround time and cargo handling speed. It also evaluates infrastructure quality, including sufficient draught, quay, and dock facilities. Connectivity to inland transportation networks, the cost-effectiveness and quality of port services, the adoption of advanced digital technologies, and effective customs and container clearance procedures are also critical factors in the index.</p><h2>Enhancing resilience through the CPPI</h2><p>Focusing on these indicators can help governments and stakeholders make informed decisions to improve port performance, driving economic growth and competitiveness.The CPPI can also help governments build port resilience to protect global supply chains from unforeseen disruptions. CPPI data can:</p><ul><li><span>dentify performance gaps: </span>The CPPI helps stakeholders pinpoint areas where a port may be underperforming. This detailed analysis enables targeted interventions to address inefficiencies, reduce delays, and optimize operations. By showcasing top-performing ports, the CPPI facilitates the adoption of best practices, promoting innovative solutions and industry standards that can significantly boost port performance.</li><li><span>Support investment decisions: </span>The CPPI provides policymakers and investors with a data-driven foundation for making informed decisions regarding infrastructure development and resource allocation. Understanding which ports excel—and why—allows stakeholders to prioritize investments in areas that will yield the highest returns in terms of efficiency gains and economic impact.</li><li><span>Foster collaboration and policy development: </span>The CPPI fosters greater collaboration among various stakeholders involved in port operations. By providing a standard set of performance indicators, the index facilitates discussions and partnerships between port authorities, shipping lines, regulatory agencies, and other entities. This collaborative approach is essential for developing cohesive policies and strategies that address systemic challenges and promote sustainable port development.</li></ul><p>Container ports are indispensable for maintaining the stability and efficiency of global supply chains, particularly in developing countries where they drive economic growth. By investing in port infrastructure and efficiency and closely monitoring performance through key indicators—like those provided by the CPPI—countries can harness the full potential of their ports and protect supply chains from future disruptions. This approach will not only build port competitiveness in the global market but also ensure that goods continue to flow smoothly, keeping shelves stocked and prices stable even in times of global uncertainty.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Given the global concern about the existential threat posed by climate change, government subsidies aimed at spurring green technologies and the green transition—from solar panels to electric vehicles—can play a greater role. And the number of subsidies with green objectives is indeed increasing, according to the World Bank’s new Green Subsidies Database. </p><p>The new database supplements the 2023 World Bank report, “Unfair Advantage: Distortive Subsidies and Their Effects on Global Trade,” which found that subsidies of all types have been rising since 2008. Governments are increasingly turning to subsidies amid rising geopolitical tensions fueled by climate change, national security concerns, and the race to gain an edge in frontier technologies.  Yet, even when deployed in pursuit of legitimate goals, subsidies can harm trading partners, fuel tensions, and provoke countermeasures. They can nullify the benefits of global trade and investment by distorting international prices and limiting market access, as in the case of local content requirements, and they can create inefficiencies in global value chains.</p><p>The new database identifies government subsidy programs with stated environmental objectives by sector and compares data for 2022 and 2018. It shows that among green subsidies, priorities are evolving toward programs that support innovation related to green technologies and clean energy goals, such as faster adoption of renewable fuels. China and the United States deploy the largest number of subsidy programs, followed by Australia, Canada, and the European Union. All are large trading economies that have the potential to influence global markets. Most programs are offered by sub-central governments, such as states and provinces.</p><p>Ambitious climate objectives, market failures, and existing incentives that favor fossil fuel use can justify greater use of green subsidies. Yet there is a risk that some types of subsidies could distort trade or have effects that limit the free flows of goods, services, and technologies that are needed not only to fight climate change but also to reduce poverty. The World Bank will continue to track these measures as it seeks to increase transparency, deepen analysis on their nature and economic effects, and foster informed discussions among countries on the appropriate use and design of government subsidies.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Today, many countries face severe pressure on water resources resulting from a complex array of factors, including inadequate planning, inefficient systems, failures to recover the costs of providing this vital resource, and the accelerating effects of climate change. On the demand side of the equation, this means the world must manage water more efficiently.</p><p>In Indonesia, one of the top rice producers in the world, agriculture uses 80% of the country’s water. Small-scale irrigation continues to play an important role in production, with more than 20% of farmers—often from the poorest parts of society—using this type of system. About 40% of Indonesia’s 7.2 million hectares of irrigated land uses small-scale systems, making this method an important contributor to reducing poverty, improving food security, and supporting livelihoods. But many of these systems, despite past investments aimed at achieving rice self-sufficiency, have fallen into neglect. In 2014, roughly 46% of irrigation systems in Indonesia were in poor condition, and almost 90,000 hectares of irrigated land are converted to other purposes every year. Although there have been improvements in recent years, the growth of national rice production, coupled with infrastructure damage and limited budgets for maintenance, has led to a vicious cycle of “build, neglect, and rebuild,” poor performance, and low productivity.</p><p>Indonesia has undergone an important shift in its water and irrigation sector toward a decentralized and strengthened system of service delivery. Local governments are now primarily responsible for the management of these systems, but they face huge capacity and resource challenges. This is compounded by Indonesia’s geography—as the world’s largest archipelagic country, there are more than 500 local governments on nearly 13,500 islands, making service delivery particularly challenging. </p><p>Local governments rely on fiscal transfers from the central government toward operations and maintenance services in irrigation schemes, but increasing investment in one irrigation scheme reduces allocations for other schemes, which could result in infrastructure disparities. Local government-owned irrigation infrastructure is also deteriorating at a rate of between 5% and 10% each year, which compounds the problem. Allocating resources toward a particular irrigation scheme at the expense of another is a difficult decision that requires weighing up the investment against efficiency and equitable distribution concerns.</p><p>The World Bank is working with the government of Indonesia to explore how local governments support can deliver better results and quality in irrigation systems. At a recent workshop, the Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing worked with the World Bank’s Water Global Practice to examine how performance-based instruments can be used to guide investment decisions and make small-scale irrigation more sustainable and financially viable.</p><p>The World Bank has a wealth of knowledge on how results-based financing can be used to incentivize local governments to improve the quality of their service delivery, but these experiences have predominantly operated across other sectors, such as water supply, transport, and solid waste management. This has led to many good practices which can be applied to small-scale irrigation. Replicating this instrument to irrigation might provide similar incentives to local governments to improve the quality of irrigation service delivery.</p><p>The World Bank is supporting the government of Indonesia’s National Urban Water Supply Project, which provides results-based fiscal transfers to local water companies. This innovative solution incentivizes utilities to improve their services and is having a substantial impact, provided it is implemented alongside capacity building for local stakeholders, with clear agreements on performance indicators and monitoring. This approach is also most successful when aligned with a government's budget cycle and systems.</p><p>The efficient use of small-scale irrigation can significantly improve income and food security for Indonesia’s people. By strengthening performance-based fund transfers to local governments, small-scale irrigation can play a major role in the efforts to alleviate poverty, bolster water security, and build climate resilience.</p>"

      "content": "<p>The World Bank's agriculture raw material price index has been relatively stable since the start of the year, as gains in cotton and natural rubber prices were offset by declines in other components. The index is expected to edge down in 2024 and rise somewhat in 2025 as demand strengthens. Global growth prospects present a key risk to the forecast.</p><p><span>Cotton prices fell to a four-year low in May due to better-than-expected supply prospects. </span>Cotton prices plunged 11 percent in May (m/m) and are now 18 percent lower than they were a year ago. The recent decline is driven by a promising supply outlook for the upcoming 2024-25 crop season. According to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture assessment, global cotton production is expected to increase by nearly 5 percent during the 2024-25 season. Significant output surges in Brazil (+15 percent) and the U.S. (+33 percent) will more than compensate declines in China (-2 percent) and India (-4 percent), the world’s dominant suppliers. With a projected 3 percent rise in consumption, the global stock-to-use ratio (a measure of supply availability relative to demand) is expected to stay relatively stable at around 71 percent. Prices are anticipated to remain stable in 2024, before slightly increasing in 2025 as supply growth moderates. However, larger-than-anticipated global economic growth is a key upside risk to the price outlook.</p><p><span>Natural rubber prices continued to rise in May due to ongoing supply concerns. </span>Prices increased by 3 percent during the month, marking a 24 percent rise from the same period last year. This sustained price strength is primarily driven by weather-related supply issues, including limited rainfall in Southeast Asia, partially linked to El Niño, which is nearing its end. Production declines in Thailand (down over 9 percent in the 12 months ending April) and Indonesia (-15 percent), the world's largest natural rubber suppliers, have only been partially offset by increases in Côte d'Ivoire (+23 percent) and other regions (+4 percent). Demand for natural rubber remains robust, particularly from the automotive sector, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of global consumption. In 2023, global tire production grew by 4.9 percent for light vehicles and 2.4 percent for heavier vehicles. Following a 10 percent decline in 2023, natural rubber prices are expected to gain momentum in 2024 and 2025 as production recovers in key producing countries. However, an unexpected downturn in auto production, possibly due to a supply glut in China, poses a significant downside risk to this forecast.</p>"

      "content": "<p>As we celebrate World Ocean Day this June 8th, let us draw inspiration from the Comoros, where community-led fisheries management is a strategy and a way of life that honors the ocean's generosity while safeguarding its future.</p><p>As the waves of the Indian Ocean caress the shores of the Comoros, the archipelago nation celebrates the bounty of its seas, particularly during the joyful season of February when the octopus fishing communities welcome the opening of the season after months of closure. This period marks a time of festivity and also reflection on the sustainable practices that have been integrated into their way of life, a topic that resonates deeply as we approach World Ocean Day.</p><p>The Comoros has a vast exclusive economic zone that is 85 times larger than its land area, a very significant potential of marine resources in promoting sustainable and inclusive development. However, this potential has not been fully realized and is often addressed in a fragmented way. As an island nation, effectively managing fisheries and coastal areas is crucial for environmental conservation and for ensuring food security and economic stability.</p><p>Our team’s research and development of the Country Environmental Analysis of Comoros revealed the rich but degraded coastal and marine ecosystems, with fishing practices facing growing pressure. In response, our report recommended the nation actively promote sustainable fisheries and integrated management of marine and coastal areas. Embracing this advice, Comoros is now working to strengthen coastal zone management and expand protected areas. It has also developed a high-level strategy aimed at empowering local communities to lead this effort.</p><p>Community-led management is more than just a concept; it's a transformative approach that instills a sense of responsibility and leadership in the management of local resources. Its goal is to ensure that the benefits of protected areas are experienced locally by current and future generations, improving living conditions and fostering a connection between the environment, education, and collective action.</p><p>The Comoros has put this approach into action with co-managed and community-led fisheries. The World Bank-supported Coastal Resources Co-management for Sustainable Livelihood Project was instrumental in developing co-management agreements across Grande Comores, Mohéli, and Anjouan, specifically focused on developing human and institutional capacity and executing fisheries management plans.</p><p>The journey towards sustainable fisheries management is not easy, as some community members struggle with seasonal closures and prioritize immediate financial gains. However, the long-term benefits are becoming more apparent. The combined efforts and collaborative approach are resulting in larger and more plentiful catches, proving the effectiveness of community-led initiatives.</p><p>Mrs. Mariama Mahamoud, president of the Sadampoini Women's Fishing Cooperative in Anjouan, shares her experience: ''All the fish we eat comes from Chiroroni, our co-management site. The site has become very productive since we implemented sustainable management measures, including closed seasons. We are now organizing a fisherwomen's cooperative to process and add value to our products.''</p><p>Building on the foundation of previous projects, the Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (SWIOFish1) set clear performance targets for Comoros, holding regular co-management meetings and ensuring the registration and authorization of fishing operations in compliance with the law. The journey continues with the Food Systems Resilience Programme for Eastern and Southern Africa Phase 3 (FSRP3), which includes Comoros and is supported by the Global Blue Economy Program – PROBLUE. FSRP3 aims to enhance the resilience of food systems and preparedness for times of food insecurity. It focuses on fisheries-related activities as a critical evaluation of past co-management efforts and as a guide for future expansion. Through these projects, we are reminded that when we work together, we can achieve a balance between our needs and the health of the marine ecosystems that sustain us.</p>"

      "content": "<p>Small Island Developing States (SIDS)—think Bahamas, Belize, Fiji—are some of the most exotic and environmentally striking places in the world. The group of 57 heterogenous states, including those across the Caribbean and Oceania - from Antigua to Vanuatu - are some of the world’s most biodiverse destinations.</p><p>SIDS rank amongst some of the world’s most vulnerable countries, highly exposed to external shocks, global warming-induced rising sea levels and other risks due to climate change. Unless substantial investments are made to mitigate climate change, boost adaptation, and build more resilient economies, they face urgent climate and financial risks.</p><p>Here are four things to know about SIDS, climate change, and development financing.</p><span>1. SIDS are among the world’s most exposed countries to climate change.</span>Out of the 192 countries ranked in the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index sub-index of exposure to climate change, 10 of the 19 countries in the most exposed decile are SIDS. This exposure mainly stems from their geographical characteristics; many are in tropical cyclone zones and a large share of their land area is made of low-lying coastal land, exposing them to both storms and sea level rises. </p><img src='https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/SIDS-Ranking-of-36-SIDS-in-the-ND-GAIN-sub-index-of-Exposure-to-Climate-Change?qlt=90&fmt=webp&resMode=sharp2'><p><span>2. SIDS are especially vulnerable to tropical cyclone disasters. </span>Tropical cyclones cause most of the damage from natural disasters in SIDS. The EM-DAT database records 185 episodes of tropical cyclone disasters within Caribbean SIDS and 74 within Oceania from 1995 to 2022. These disasters caused US$ 45 billion in damages in the Caribbean and US$ 2 billion in Oceania (in 2022 prices). In 20 occasions since 1995, tropical cyclones have caused damages estimated at more than 10% of GDP in the Caribbean and Oceania—and in eight of these cases, the estimated damages exceeded 50 percent of GDP. In terms of damages as a share of GDP, some of the smallest SIDS—such as St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada and Dominica have experienced the most extreme damages due to cyclones, because their GDP is relatively small. But in terms of the absolute value of estimated damages, SIDS with larger economies—including Cuba, the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic—have suffered the largest aggregate damages, in part because they have more economic assets exposed to damages from cyclones.</p><img src='https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/Largest-cyclone-disasters-in-Caribbean-and-Oceanian-SIDS-1995-2022-damages-as-a-percent-of-GDP?qlt=90&fmt=webp&resMode=sharp2'><p><span>3. Estimated requirements for public investment in climate change adaptation are substantial—some countries require up to 20% of their GDP to build resilience against climate change. </span>Investing in adaptation for climate change falls into three main categories:</p><p>i. Upgrading new investment projects to make physical assets more resilient to climate change.</p><p>ii. Retrofitting existing physical assets to make them more resilient.</p><p>iii. Investing in coastal defences.</p><p>Estimates of average annual investment requirements—what countries need for climate adaptation—varies across SIDS. But for most, these requirements are substantial because of their high exposure to climate change and the difficulty of achieving economies of scale in small economies. The table below provides estimated requirements for annual public investments in adaptation across all categories in some SIDS over the next decade.</p><p><span>4. For about a third of SIDS, the public debt to GDP ratio is very high, but concessional finance can boost adaptation to climate change. </span>The burden of public debt varies across SIDS, but for over 30% of them, public debt is high. The nominal value of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt to GDP ratio is above 60 %. For two SIDS (Antigua and Barbuda, and Suriname), the PPG debt is unsustainable. Another two SIDS are in debt distress, and 14 are judged to be at a high risk of debt distress. A high debt burden constrains the fiscal space that SIDS have for investments in climate change adaptation. </p><p>Overall, SIDS need significantly more financial and, in some cases, technical assistance to make vital investments in adaptation which can mitigate the risks that they face from climate related shocks. But it’s not all bad news. Some estimates indicate that for most SIDS, financing adaptation is feasible, especially with sufficient support from development partners, through grants and similar options. This means that the approach to planning and implementing climate change adaptation in small island countries needs to be efficient, systematic, and mainstreamed into each country’s broader national development strategies, so that it complements other development goals and minimises potential trade-offs.</p><p>Most importantly, there is an opportunity for development partners to maximize global impact by investing in the world’s most vulnerable places. Through effective use of concessional finance, the world could see long-term, large-scale benefits to investments in climate change adaptation. With the right assistance, small island developing states can become more livable,  and play a key role in unlocking the reality of shared global prosperity.</p>"

      "content": "<p>When thinking about Nepal, it is the towering snowy peaks that come to mind first. Yet, beyond lofty mountains, a remarkable tale of conservation has been unfolding in Nepal’s jungles.</p><p>Over the past decades, Nepal is the only developing country in the world that doubled its forest cover to 45 percent. Nepal has further tripled its tiger population to 355 wild cats in the last 15 years.</p><p>At the core of these successes are the efforts of individuals, partnerships, and policies, as well as the World Bank's early and crucial role in uniting governments and investing in Nepal's protected areas. Their focus on monitoring, management, anti-poaching measures, and enforcing conservation laws has been essential in protecting the endangered tiger.</p><h2>The Wide-Reaching Benefits of Saving a Single Tiger</h2><p>Tigers are part of Nepal’s natural capital. As apex predators, tigers have cascading effects on their ecosystems. By limiting the number of herbivores, they prevent overgrazing, which allows grasses, bushes, and forests to grow. The roots of these bushes and trees slow the release of groundwater, helping prevent floods and river silting, and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events on the communities. To protect just one tiger, an estimated 10,000 hectares of forest is conserved. Tigers also bring prosperity to the people. Chitwan National Park, which is home to the largest tiger population in Nepal with an estimated 126 cats, attracts more than 300,000 visitors every year. This generates over 4,000 full-time tourism jobs and provides an essential source of income to the local community. Every rupee spent by visitors raises the income of local households around the park by 1.78 rupees.</p><h2>The World Bank’s Involvement</h2><p>2008 was a pivotal year for global tiger conservation. Based on the commitment of its then-president, Robert B. Zoellick, the World Bank Group threw its weight behind wildlife conservation, partnering with the Global Environment Facility, the Smithsonian Institution, and other wildlife conservation organizations to establish the Global Tiger Initiative (GTI). Global Tiger Initiative (GTI), led by the 13 tiger range countries, was launched as a global alliance of governments, international organizations, civil society, conservationists, scientists, and businesses to save the wild tiger (later broadened to include the snow leopard) from extinction. The World Bank Group hosted the GTI Secretariat up until 2015. In 2010, the leaders of the 13 countries responsible for the remaining wild tiger populations committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022.</p><p>To date, Nepal is the only country that has achieved this goal. But Nepal’s success did not happen overnight. It started with strong political commitment. Nepal’s Prime Minister heads the National Tiger Conservation Committee, which drives tiger conservation policy. As part of this commitment, Nepal introduced a zero-poaching policy and strengthened regional cooperation and wildlife crime control.</p><p>Working together with conservation partners, the government community support programs on forest restoration, conservation, and livelihoods while implementing the Tiger Conservation Action Plan (2016-2020) and Terai Arc Landscape (TAL) program. TAL strategically established community-based institutions for restoration efforts and targeted conservation of functional tiger corridors. IDA played a critical role in these efforts. The Strengthening Regional Cooperation in Wildlife Protection in Asia contributed to controlling the poaching of wildlife. The project helped establish and strengthen the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN). Nepal has hosted the Secretariat of SAWEN since its inception.</p><p>However, increasing the tiger population comes with a risk, and there have been tiger attacks on humans in and around the protected areas. Research shows that 98 percent of tiger attacks happen due to encroachment of tiger territories. To prevent this, investments in and around protected areas to protect Nepal’s natural assets, grow and diversify nature-based tourism and share benefits with local communities that will help to foster human-wildlife co-existence. These investments will allow better management of tiger habitat, enhance the infrastructures for tourism opportunities, and provide alternative livelihood opportunities. In the meantime, a relief package for victim of human-wildlife conflict was put in place by the Government of Nepal.</p><h2>What more needs to be done?</h2><p>Nepal still hasn’t fully realized the potential offered by its natural capital. For example, the country can build on its conservation success by promoting nature-based tourism. Additional investment, both public and private, is needed to make the Protected Areas more welcoming and to attract higher-paying tourists. Strategic investment in protected areas and nature-based tourism can create opportunities to diversify income and support local economies for high-value and greener growth in Nepal, while also mitigating impacts of climate change. Leveraging these opportunities and bringing nature into rural development planning is essential for Nepal’s Green, Resilient, and Inclusive Development (GRID) vision. </p><p>Nepal’s success with tiger conservation and its potential for creating wider benefits shows that with the right tools and policies in place, Nepal can become a beacon of biodiversity and a trailblazer for balancing nature and prosperity on a livable planet. </p>"

      "content": "<p>Global food commodity prices stabilized in April 2024, following six consecutive quarterly declines. The World Bank’s food price index is projected to decrease by 6 percent in 2024 and 4 percent in 2025. However, several risks underpin these price forecasts, including energy and fertilizer costs, potential maritime chokepoints, and weather-related supply shortfalls. In the longer term, biofuel policies could affect food prices.</p><h2>Energy and fertilizer costs are easing.</h2><p>Energy and fertilizer prices are expected to decline by 3 and 22 percent, respectively, in 2024, with further declines projected in 2025. However, escalations of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East can push up energy prices and adversely affect fertilizer production—pushing food prices higher than forecast. Moreover, fertilizer producers in the Black Sea region, the Middle East, and North Africa heavily rely on the Suez Canal for exports, and this route could become unviable if Red Sea shipping disruptions intensify, raising the cost of transporting fertilizers to end-users.</p><h2>Rerouting of grain shipments from Suez to Cape of Good Hope intensifies.</h2><p>In 2023, more than 14 percent of global seaborne grains and oilseeds trade passed through the Suez Canal, a considerably higher share than for crude oil and metals. Recent attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea prompted significant rerouting from the Suez Canal to around the Cape of Good Hope. During December and January, an estimated 4.3 million tons of grains and oilseeds were diverted in this manner, mostly affecting U.S. soybean exports and EU wheat exports to Asia. Thus far, however, grain and oilseed prices have not been significantly affected, partly because ships originating from the Black Sea region—a major source of grain and oilseeds—have continued to take the Red Sea route. If the conflict intensifies, however, prompting vessels from the Black Sea to also divert, substantial delays, increased shipment costs, and higher prices could materialize.</p><h2>Emergence of La Niña.</h2><p>The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts a weakening of El Niño weather conditions, with an 85 percent chance of transitioning to neutral conditions by April-June 2024. The probability of a subsequent La Niña onset between June and August 2024 has increased to 60 percent. La Niña conditions typically result in wetter than normal conditions in Australia, northern Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and southeastern Africa, while bringing unusually dry weather in Argentina, southern Brazil, and the United States Gulf Coast. The weakening of El Niño and the likely emergence of La Niña is anticipated to alleviate price pressures on commodities like cocoa, food oils, natural rubber, rice, and sugar in 2025. If these weather forecasts fail to materialize, prices may surpass expectations.</p><h2>Diversion of food commodities to biofuels.</h2><p>Production of biofuels is expected to increase  considerably in the medium to longer term. For example, the International Energy Agency expects a 30 percent increase in biofuel demand from 2023-28 relative to the previous five years. Emerging and developing economies such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia are expected to drive over 60 percent of demand growth through supportive policies, rising demand for transport fuel, and the ample availability of feedstock, even though the majority of current production occurs in advanced economies. The share of biodiesel demand in total palm oil production in Indonesia and Malaysia is projected to rise from 19 percent in 2022 to 30 percent by 2028. Additionally, in the United States, eight midwestern states will be permitted to sell gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol year-round from April 2025. The forecasts assume that this policy-derived support for biofuel demand will continue. However, if these policies do not unfold as planned (or they are intensified), there may be downward (or upward) pressure on prices of key food commodities, including some grains, vegetable oils, and sugar.</p><p><span>Despite easing of global food prices acute food insecurity increased. </span>Although food prices have stabilized during the past few quarters, should any of the risks discussed above materialize, it could further exacerbate the number of people experiencing acute food insecurity in food crisis countries, which has already increased from 113 million in 2018 to 282 million in 2023.</p>"
